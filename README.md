AI-powered video upscaling application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript.

TuxScale uses the [upscayl-ncnn](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn) backend to upscale videos using Real-ESRGAN models via Vulkan compute.

## Credits

TuxScale is inspired by and builds upon the fantastic work of [Upscayl](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl) — the #1 free and open-source AI image upscaler. Special thanks to the Upscayl team for their backend ([upscayl-ncnn](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn)) and inspiration.

## How it works

TuxScale extracts frames from a video using FFmpeg, upscales each frame using the [upscayl-ncnn](https://github.com/upscayl/upscayl-ncnn) Vulkan-based AI inference engine, and reassembles the upscaled frames back into a video — all through an intuitive desktop UI.

The app bundles the upscayl-ncnn backend binary and AI models inside the package via `extraResources` in electron-builder. The backend binary is downloaded fresh from the latest upstream release during CI builds, so it stays up to date without manual tracking.

## Prerequisites

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (with ffprobe) installed on your system
- A Vulkan-compatible GPU

## Project Setup

### Install

```bash
$ bun install
```

### Development

```bash
$ bun run dev
```

### Build (Linux only)

```bash
$ bun run build:linux
```

This produces the following artifacts in `dist/`:
- **AppImage** — portable Linux executable
- **.deb** — Debian/Ubuntu package
- **.rpm** — Fedora/RHEL package
- **.pkg.tar.zst** — Arch Linux pacman package

## CI Builds

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) that can be triggered **manually** from the Actions tab in the GitHub UI:

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. Select **Build Linux** from the left sidebar
4. Click **Run workflow** → **Run workflow**

The workflow will:
1. Download the latest upscayl-bin backend binary from the upscayl-ncnn release
2. Install dependencies with Bun
3. Build the Electron app targeting Linux (AppImage, deb, rpm, pacman)
4. Upload all artifacts to the workflow run
5. Create a GitHub Release with the artifacts attached

All four Linux package formats are automatically available for download from the release.
